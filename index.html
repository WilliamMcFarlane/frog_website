        <ol>
            <li> Frogs have ears. Male frogs have bigger ears than females. Their ears are just behind their eyes.  </li>
            <li> Frogs ‘drink’ through their skin. </li>
            <li> There isn’t actually a biological difference between frogs and toads. Toads are just very warty frogs. </li>
            <li> Flying frogs can glide for 12 to 15 metres, as they have extremely effective webbed feet.  </li>
